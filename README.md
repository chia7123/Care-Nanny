# Care Nanny

This project is intended to develop a native mobile app that connects new mothers with confinement ladies who offer confinement services. This application is initially designed for Android devices, but plans are in place to release versions for other types of devices once the Android version is stable.

The primary feature of the application will allow new mothers to easily locate and connect with confinement ladies in their area using GPS tracking. Additionally, the application will include other features that will make it more user-friendly and convenient for new mothers to use.
